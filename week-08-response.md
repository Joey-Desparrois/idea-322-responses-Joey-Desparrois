By using speculative storytelling, Afro-Futurism reimagines Black history, present, and future, often challenging contemporary society. Contemporary social issues are often reflected in science fiction. The themes of race, identity, colonialism, and social inequality are particularly prominent in Afro-Futurism. It allows us to examine and critique today's societal norms and power structures by projecting them into imagined futures or alternate realities.

   There are no direct connections between this exhibition and traditional science fiction narratives. An emphasis is placed on working with contemporary artists who are engaged with issues related to the environment, ecology, and sustainable living. A speculative lens could, however, be applied to certain elements of the exhibition. It is possible to read "Beyond Green" as a critique of how modern society treats the environment, much like science fiction. Among the issues they may address are climate change, pollution, resource depletion, and the exploitation of natural ecosystems. Our current environmental challenges are presented through artistic expression in this exhibition, which promotes reflection on them.
