I have visited a handful of museums such as the field museum, planetarium, and the aquarium. I also went to a greek museum for an art project. 

I think what makes a museum is the collections of the artifacts that are being presented. Each museum has its own theme and they attract different kinds of visitors. 

Curiosity is defined as something that is unusual, interesting, or intriguing. In general, it can be anything that piques a person's curiosity or interest, such as an object, a phenomenon, or an event. In museums, displays are used for public viewing and educational purposes to arrange and present objects.

I noticed that most museums talk about their principles, mission statements, exhibits, and interactions with those who are visiting.

If i could make something into an archive it would have to be all of my videos that i have made while playing video games with friends and family. Almost every session i have atleast a short clip that has came from said session. Its something ive always done just to document moments of us playing together and making it history. If i ever opened it to the public the only purpose i think it would give is just entertainment, much like how you tune in to your favorite tv show. 

The name of this museum is The Capture Vault
