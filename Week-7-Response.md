The project i found most engaging to me was the Plasticful Foods project. It is a product that is made from organic ingredients and recycled plastics. The goal of this is to help clean the planet and imagine how waste isnt just "waste" and that it can be a good resource. I think that its pretty interesting to see food as plastic and quite humourous. It is a fun way to make plastic useful instead of having a negative impact for those who live on the planet.
